        <p><strong>Scholarship crafting</strong> begins with preparing myself. I should understand the opportunity at hand and ensure the org aligns with my values.Realizing why I need the opportunity clarifies my goals and motivates me to create a compelling essay. The first paragraph should include the qualify, quantify and sanctify policy.</p>
        <p><strong>middle</strong></p> I should use good sentence transition, paragraph transition, the impact of my experiences and relate to the organization which could be describing some sessions or naming a few alumni. Including the impact of my experiences enhances a vivid picture of my journey and its impact towards my readiness for the opportunity.
        <p><strong>ending</strong> should rephrase why I stand out. To leave a long impression, I should end with a memorable quote. "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." -Winston Churchill</p>

        <p><strong>Public Speaking</strong>As the quote states, is the art of diluting a two-minute idea with a two-hour vocabulary." by John F. Kennedy. It involves taking a concise idea that could be communicated in just a few minutes and expanding it into a longer speech. 
            The general purpose of speech is to inform, inspire, persuade and entertain. Elements of speech include: ethos, pathos and logos. By applying ethos,
        my introduction should capture my audience. I need to apply pathos to evoke emotions and influence perception and logos for logic.
        When I find myself in the role of a presenter, I will follow these steps to introduce a person: <ol><li>P: Personal intro</li>

        <p> <strong>How To Learn</strong></p>
            <p>As one with short-term memory, Kamilimu helps me through discussions but to fully improve, I must ask questions, 
            answer questions and take notes. Some of the good learning habits I have learnt include chunking, Retrieval practice and working with procrastination.
            I have learnt that through chunking I will see the bigger picture of large piece of data.
            Read while the ink is fresh, for only then can the mind truly absorb the essence of the words." - Leonardo da Vinci. Reviewing quotes the next day while the topic is still fresh in mind enhances retentiona good
            practice that I'll adopt to break the habit of staying up all night cramming for exams. Retelling what I learn and asking myself
            questions before exam will enforce my understanding and help me identify areas where I need further study. Rewarding myself after completing tiresome work provides motivation and helps me maintain a
            healthy balance between productivity and relaxation.</p>
